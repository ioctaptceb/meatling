# meetling
Hiya

so this will focus on the project that I did when I first started at bitcrowd. It was my first angular app, and also the first time that I worked with ES6, so there was a lot to know. 

To start, here were some of my major resources:
ES6 Boilerplate with babel, browserify: https://github.com/thoughtram/es6-babel-browserify-boilerplate

John Papaâ€™s style guide for angular: https://github.com/johnpapa/angularjs-styleguide

unit testing modules with karma (from airpair) https://www.airpair.com/angularjs/posts/testing-angular-with-karma

Angularjs tutorial and reference: https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_00

ES6 modules reference: http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html

ES6 class reference: http://www.2ality.com/2015/02/es6-classes-final.html

protractor reference: http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/

babel reference https://babeljs.io/

authentication http://jasonwatmore.com/post/2015/03/10/AngularJS-User-Registration-and-Login-Example.aspx#app

..more that will be added over time

The task:
learn angular while also learning es6, and adhering to the styleguide.

The app: 
Meetling - a way to set up meetings with people, anywhere in the world, with automatic time synchronization. and some sort of light algorithm of when they are probably asleep, probably at work, etc.

The assumptions - 
-users will register and can register their friends
-maybe later there will be something more

The sketch: 
Login page - enter details or register
Cuttingboard - same section as login -- but is also the drag and drop area for meetlings to be arranged
Meetshop - sidebar / slidy that contains a list of friends (can be added to)
Meetbin - sidebar / slidy that contains a calendar with times and meetlings

actual sketch will eventually follow
